            <p>So you want to learn jQuery? Well first, you need a solid foundation in <a href="http://codecademy.com" target="_blank">JavaScript and CSS</a>. Once you got that down, come back here and I'll teach you jQuery in this article.</p>
            <p>So what is jQuery? jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.</p>
            <p>jQuery is a global variable and a shorthand form of it is $. Inside the parameters of jQuery function, you put in DOM elements. DOM stands for Document Object Model. Example of a DOM element are p, ul, body, etc. It is basically html tags. Once you select a DOM element, you can apply an method to it. There are many methods to use and throughout this article, I will show you some. Here is a simple example of what I just explained.</p>
          </div>
          <iframe height="120" src="http://jsfiddle.net/birkal/k43Rt/embedded/result,html,js" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          <p>I selected the <strong>ul li</strong> element and apply a css method of changing its color to blue. Another method is to add a class to a DOM element like this:</p>
          <iframe height="120" src="http://jsfiddle.net/birkal/T4MF2/embedded/result,html,js,css" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          <p>Getting a DOM element with jQuery is similar to getting an element in css. It is basically a selector. Furthermore, make sure you put your script tags at the bottom or add a document.ready method because jQuery won't work if you are trying to work with the DOM before it is fully loaded. Another way is passing an anonymous function instead of the document.ready method.</p>
          <iframe height="200" src="http://jsfiddle.net/birkal/qY6G9/embedded/js" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          <p>Next up, we'll take a look at the DOM traversal methods: childen, find, first, eq, next, prev, parent, parents, and closest method.</p>
          <iframe height="350" src="http://jsfiddle.net/birkal/7Bbk6/embedded/result,html,js,css" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          <p>Good, did you get all of that? Yeah, me too. Let's move on... oh alright, I'll explain it. First line get the ul.container children and sets their color to blue. Next line it gets all of ul.wrapper list items instead of child, meaning this includings li within another ul or any other element such as div, etc. The third method gets the first li and sets it color to green.</p> 
          <p>The fourth method gets the second list item and changes it text to 2nd. The fifth method get the second list items as well but tranverses the dom back and forth to the next li item. This is called chaining methods together. The sixth method removes span class emphasis and the seventh method gets the parent of span and changes it background color to yellow. The last two methods gets the span parent element. The difference between parents and closest is parents gets all of span parent elements while closest gets the closest one only.</p>
          <p>Events involves user interaction like hovering or clicking. I'll be showing you this with a simple day/night button interaction web page. Now, I'm going to put all my jQuery in a self invoking anonymous function instead of putting it in the global scope as it is a JavaScript best practice. Also, everytime you are using $(), you are diving in the DOM and each time you do it, it takes up resources. So try to do it as least you possibly can. I will be diving once and setting it to a variable. This is called caching.</p>
          <iframe height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/birkal/fZW6A/embedded/result,html,js,css" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          <p>So first I'm caching the body element because everytime the button is click, it is diving into the DOM to get the body element when you just needed to get it once. Next I set a on click event when the button is click. Within the event, I cach the button that is clicked itself and the data-name. What is the data-name? Well if you look in the html, I set a data-name attribute to both buttons to distinguish between the two. In HTML5, you are allow custom attributes with the data- attribute. This is just one way of distinguishing between both buttons, you can do if statement or get the content inside the button, etc.</p>
          <p>So I get the data name of the button which would either be day or night. Then I change the body attribute with the attr method and set it to the button data name that was click. Next, I want to disabled the button that was click so the user doesn't spam click it, wasting resources. I called the siblings method which gets the specified element all within the same level. I removed the attribute disabled from it if it has one and then the end method refers back to the other button(which is the one that was clicked) and adds a disabled attribute. This is fairly simple, there are other ways to do it, so try experiminting with it.</p>
          <p>I'm going to make a company faq that shows and hides the answers to show you more about events and event delegation. So I will be using a definition list which is the dl tag, and inside I will have the dt and dd tags. One being the question and the other the answer. I will be hiding all the answers except the first one one page load by using the filter method.</p>
          <iframe height="400" src="http://jsfiddle.net/birkal/Mr78j/2/embedded/result,html,js,css" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          <p>So here on line 4, I'm using event delegation on the dl tag instead of using it each and every one of the dt tag because it is better for performance. Putting an event on every dt tag can reduce your performance severely the more dt tags you have. In the second argument, I specify that I want to activate the event when it is on the dt tag and mouseenter is simliar to hover in the first argument. Now I select the next one after the dt tag which is the dd tag, which is the answer in the faq. I slide that down 200 milliseconds and get all the other dd tags with the siblings methods and slide those up 200 milliseconds to create an accordion effect.</p>
          <p>I reccommend that you do not use the bind, live, and delegate methods because they just reference the on method, so just used that, less to memorized.</p>
          <iframe height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/birkal/TYstL/1/embedded/result,html,js" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          <p>Here, I just set an event on the body when the p is click, it fires an event of cloning itself and appending itself to the body.</p>
          <p>Next, you should take a look at jQuery's various methods that allow us to add content to the DOM. They are the append, prepend, insertAfter, insertBefore, after, and before methods. Take a look at it <a href="http://api.jquery.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Also, you can add elements by adding tags $('&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;', {text: 'something', class: 'myclass'}); like this and you can pass a object in the second parameter to add text, a class, or styles for modification.</p>
          <p>Next up, let's take a look at the animate method. The animate method performs a custom animation of a set of CSS properties.</p>
          <p>After all of this, you now know all the basics of jQuery. Now let's TRANSCEND!</p>
