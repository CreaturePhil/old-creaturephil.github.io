            <p>That's right! This is a meta blog which means I will be blogging about blogging. Don't denied it, you knew this was going to happen eventually. I never really tried to blog before so I'm a noob at this. Try and bear it with will ya? "Haha just kidding." That is my catchphrase, "most of the time". That is also my catchphrase. I am funny, aren't I?</p> 
            <p>Alright enough with that, I have no clue what I was trying to do just then. I am not removing that in the final draft. I don't even do rough drafts then again proofreading. Oh please, do you think I do that shit? Hmmm, I probably have like one or zero readers. Anywho, I'm doing this for myself but hey if you are reading this. Thank you! It means the world to me. Haha just kidding.</p>
            <p>Alright then, enough with the random shitposting, let's get down to the meta business. Hey my man Stevo, you are going to be proofreading my blogs now. This is what friends do for each other (I hope). So, after two days start to blog, it is actually getting harder. I was planning to write a blog post on "People you should follow" but I didn't know how to start. I should read more blogs to see how to actually blog correctly.</p>
            <p>Most (there is only two) of my blog posts so far have been fairly short. I'm going to try and make this blog post, as long as a possibly can. Now that I think about it, I actually like short blog posts that get right to their point. Oh well, I can let one of my blog posts be long even though this isn't really my style, do you know what I mean? This is a hidden update here, turns out that breaking big paragraphs up into smaller is good as it organizes your thoughts and easy to read. This blog post is not so much meta as in me typing everything that I'm thinking at the moment.</p>
            <p>Alright, so I have ran out of ideas of what to type now. I'm just going to learn MEAN Stack and read coding horror blogs to get better. In my original draft, I was going to say "Thanks for reading!" but that is too cheesy.</p>
            <p>Also I noticed I used a lot of quotation marks in this blog post and I know what you are thinking my friend, you think I have it but I may actually have it (insert lol here but I can't actually do this since this is a blog post and it has to be official and everything). This may be my worst blog post yet. I probably should never do this again. As one of my friend has stated, this blog post is like okay, I'm going to keep blogging type post. That was a very insightful comment on his part and I thank him for sharing that with me. I have no idea what direction I want this blog to go in, only time can tell.</p>
