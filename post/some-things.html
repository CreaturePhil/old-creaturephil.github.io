            <p>I've been doing some various things. That is the one true sentence I just wrote to help me kickstart this blog post because I been stuck on what to write about for awhile. I got this one true sentence idea from Hemingway I believe as it help him start writing on his short stories. A page with one sentence is better than just a blank page. Also, I found out about this idea from a great website called Quora.</p>
            <p><strong>Quora</strong> is a question-and-answer website where questions are created, answered, edited and organized by its community of users. The answers to questions are really amazing. Here is a list of some good ones that I have encountered recently:</p>

            <p>So go check 'em out or not. It is your choice not mine. Anyways, in the meantime, I've been doing a lot of a web development with Python. To be honest, it is my first time doing web development as I never really got experience working with a database. Self teaching myself this was quite painful but I learn a lot doing it the hard way even though I should have done it an easier way by taking the udacity course which I didn't find out about it until after. I still took the course and it was pretty good learning more about databases in particular like replication and sharding. In addition to caching and scaling up in the real world with the great example of reddit in the web development udacity course by Steve Huffman, the co-founder of reddit himself.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, after a few weeks, I started working with the Express framework and it has been a blast to say the least. I still have a lot more to learn and will hopefully try to maximize in the potential of being a full-stack developer.</p>
