            <p>Why should you follow people in the first place? Well, no one is forcing you so you don't have to follow anybody if you don't want to. However, following people that are well respected in their industry and have are well established in their careers can give you inspiration and great insight on their work. This allows you to gain more knowledge about the potential career paths ahead you that are similar to the individuals you follow.</p>

            <p>I'll start off with <a href="http://zachholman.com/" target="_blank">Zach Holman</a>. He is a web developer at Github and employee number nine. He is very enthusiastic about his company he is working for and that is what makes him pretty cool. His enthusiasm in his talks about his company made me realized how great start-ups are if they succeed and that there are people out there who truly love working for their company. This guy is awesome like many other people I will mention in this post. You should definitely check out his talks as they are one of the best tech talks ever.</p>

            <p>Next up is another big guy in terms of presence and following. It is <a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/" target="_blank">Addy Osmani</a>. He is a Google engineer working with the Chrome team. He is truly great to follow as he help build tools to improve developers like you and me's productivity. I'll take improving productivity any day of the week, as I want to get the job done as efficiently as possible. He also written two books and one of them which I find great is <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/" target="_blank">Learning JavaScript Design Patterns</a>, essential to any advanced JavaScript developers.</p>
            <img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2?s=460" alt="chris wanstrath in sunglasses">
            <p>Up next is <a href="http://chriswanstrath.com/" target="_blank">Chris Wanstrath</a>, the co-creator of Github. That is all I really have to say, he is the co-creator of Github for god sake! It is good to know about what it takes to start a start-up and get it off the ground like he did with his other co-creators. Watch his talks as they are awesome as well. This is going to be the last Github staff member I going to mentioned as it will get redundant. Go to <a href="https://github.com/about/team" target="_blank">Github team page</a> to see all the other amazing staff members.</p>
            <img src="http://tubularlabs.com/assets/img/team/travis.jpg" alt="travis beautiful face">
            <p>Last but definitely not least is <a href="http://travisneilson.com" target="_blank">Travis Neilson</a>. He is senior product designer of Tabular Labs and also is a youtuber called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners/videos" target="_blank">DevTips</a>. He gives out great design tips that is significant whether you be a designer or developer. He also is the one that truly introduced me to the power of sass and also why sass indented flavour is better.</p>
            <p>Hopefully, you gain insight on why following people is excellent and that this help you get a good start on awesome people that you should follow.</p>
