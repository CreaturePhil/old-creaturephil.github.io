<p>Why should you follow people in the first place? Well, no one is forcing you so you don&#39;t have to follow anybody if you don&#39;t want to. But, following people can give you inspiration and great insight on their work. This allows you to gain more knowledge about the potential career paths ahead you.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start off with <a href="http://zachholman.com/">Zach Holman</a>. He is a web developer and employee number nine at Github. He is enthusiastic about his company he is working for and that is what makes him pretty cool. Holman&#39;s enthusiasm in his talks made me realized how great working for  startups are. Also, that there are people out there who love working for their company. This guy is awesome like many other people I will mention in this post. You should definitely check out his talks as they are one of the best tech talks ever.</p>
