<p>I&#39;m currently using a Windows netbook. This is because I have no money sadly. It is the Eee PC model and manufacture by ASUS. It is on a Windows 7 Ultimate. Processor is Intel Atom CPU N450 @ 1.67GHz and 1.00 GB of RAM. 32-bit OS.</p>
<p>You can see why I can&#39;t install Linux. I have never used Linux before so I naturally want to start off with Ubuntu or Linux Mint but both require at least 2 GB of RAM for a smooth OS experience.</p>
<p>Now since I&#39;m running Windows, I have to find tools to make up for it&#39;s lackluster environment. I use cmder for my command prompt and I use vim as my text editor. <a href="https://github.com/bliker/cmder">Cmder</a> not only looks good with its transparency and tabs, but is also fast and highly functional with numerous options and features. Here is what cmder looks like on my computer:</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been using vim for almost a year now and it was worth it going through its high learning curve. Vim is also highly customizable and all its configuration is store in a <a href="https://github.com/CreaturePhil/vim/blob/master/_vimrc">vimrc</a> file. You can check out my vimrc file on Github. Currently, I&#39;m using gruvbox as my color scheme.</p>

<p>Some plugins I use for vim are <a href="https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim">lightline</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround">surround</a>, <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">nerdtree</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors">multiple cursors</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, I use cmder and vim. That is all I need really. I don&#39;t really program in Java much but when I use eclipse. I would use Jetbrains IDEA but it is too slow on my computer.</p>
